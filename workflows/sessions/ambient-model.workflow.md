# Ambient Model: Implementation Guide

**Date:** 2026-03-20
**Status:** Living Document — updated continuously as the workflow is executed and improved
**Spec:** `ambient-model.spec.md` — all Kinds, fields, relationships, API surface, CLI commands

---

## This Document Is Iterative

This document is updated as the workflow runs. Each time the workflow is invoked, start from the top, follow the steps, and update this document with what you learned — what worked, what broke, what the step actually requires in practice.

**The goal is convergence, not perfection on the first run.** Expect failures. Expect missing steps. Expect that the workflow itself needs fixing. When something breaks, fix this document and the relevant development context before moving on. Lessons learned are not archived in separate run log files — they are corrected in the spec, this guide, and the component context files. Git history is the audit trail.

> We start from the top each time. We update as we go. We run it until it Just Works™.

Re-reading this guide at the start of each run is valuable precisely because it may have been improved by the previous run.

---

## Overview

This document describes a reusable autonomous workflow for implementing changes to the Ambient platform. The workflow is spec-driven: the data model doc is the source of truth, and agents reconcile code status against it, plan implementation work, and execute in parallel across components.

Each invocation starts from Step 1 and works through the steps in order. Steps are updated to reflect reality as it is discovered. The workflow does not require a clean-slate implementation — it is designed to run repeatedly until code and spec converge.

---

## The Pipeline

Changes flow downstream in a fixed dependency order:

```
Spec (ambient-model.spec.md)
  └─► API (openapi.yaml)
        └─► SDK Generator
              └─► Go SDK (types, builders, clients)
                    ├─► BE  (REST handlers, DAOs, migrations)
                    ├─► CLI (commands, output formatters)
                    ├─► CP  (gRPC middleware, interceptors)
                    ├─► Operator (CRD reconcilers, Job spawning)
                    ├─► Runners (Python SDK calls, gRPC push)
                    └─► FE  (TypeScript API layer, UI components)
```

Each stage depends on the stage above it being settled. Agents must not implement downstream work against an unstable upstream.

---

## Workflow Steps

> **Each invocation: start from Step 1. Update this document before moving to the next step if anything is wrong or missing.**

### Step 1 — Acknowledge Iteration

Before doing anything else, internalize that this run may not succeed. The workflow is the product. If a step fails, edit this document to capture the failure and what the step actually requires, then retry.

Checklist:

- [ ]  Read this document top to bottom
- [ ]  Read the spec (`ambient-model.spec.md`) header to check the Last Updated date
- [ ]  Confirm you are working on the correct branch and project
- [ ]  Verify the kind cluster name: `podman ps | grep kind` (do not assume — cluster name drifts)

### Step 2 — Read the Spec

Read `specs/api/ambient-model.spec.md` in full.

Extract and hold in working memory:

- All entities and their fields
- All relationships
- All API routes
- CLI table (✅ implemented / 🔲 planned)
- Design decisions
- Session start context assembly order

This is the **desired state**. Everything else is measured against it.

### Step 3 — Assess What Has Changed

Compare the spec against the current state of the code. For each component, ask:

| Component    | What to check                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**      | Does `openapi/openapi.yaml` have all spec entities, routes, and fields? **Read the actual fragments.** For every Kind, check the schema `required[]` array against the spec ERD — field-level, not just route-level. |
| **SDK**      | Do generated types/builders/clients exist for all spec entities?                                      |
| **BE**       | Read `plugins/<kind>/model.go` for every Kind. Compare field-by-field against the Spec. Drift here is the most common source of gaps. |
| **CP**       | Does middleware handle new RBAC scopes and auth requirements?                                         |
| **CLI**      | Does `acpctl` implement every route marked ✅ in the spec CLI table?                                  |
| **Operator** | Do CRD reconcilers handle Agent-scoped session start?                                                 |
| **Runners**  | Does the runner drain inbox at session start and push correct event types?                            |
| **FE**       | Do API service layer, queries, and components exist for all new entities?                             |

**The gap table must compare Spec against every component simultaneously, field by field.** A field removal touches API, SDK, BE (model + migration), and CLI — all four must be in the gap table from the start. Do not discover mid-wave that the CLI still has a flag the API no longer accepts.

Check all three directions for every Kind:
1. Spec ERD → `model.go` — spec says field exists; is it in the model?
2. `model.go` → Spec ERD — model has a field; is it documented in the spec?
3. OpenAPI `required[]` → Spec ERD — OpenAPI marks it required; does the spec agree?

Produce a gap table:

```
ENTITY          COMPONENT   STATUS      GAP
Agent           API         missing     no routes in openapi.yaml
Agent           SDK         missing     no generated type
Agent           BE          missing     no DAO, no handler, no migration
Inbox           BE          missing     no DAO, no handler
Inbox           CLI         missing     no acpctl commands
Session.prompt  BE          present     —
```

The gap table is the implementation backlog. The Lessons Learned section at the bottom of this guide captures the accumulated state from previous runs — start from there.

### Step 4 — Break It Into Work by Agent

Decompose the gap table into per-agent work items, sequenced by pipeline order:

**Wave 1 — Spec consensus** (no code; human approval)

- Confirm gap table is complete and agreed upon
- Freeze spec for this run

**Wave 2 — API** (gates everything downstream)

- Update `openapi/openapi.yaml` for all new entities and routes
- Register routes in `routes.go`
- Add handler stubs (`501 Not Implemented`) to complete the surface
- **Security gate:** new routes use `environments.JWTMiddleware`; no user token logged; RBAC scopes documented in openapi
- **Implementation detail:** see `.claude/context/api-server-development.md`
- **Acceptance:** `make test` passes, `make binary` succeeds, `make lint` clean

**Wave 3 — SDK** (gates BE, CLI, FE)

- Run SDK generator against updated `openapi.yaml`
- Commit generated types, builders, client methods
- **Verify TS and Python client paths** for any nested resource — the generator uses the first path segment as base path; nested resources require hand-written extension files
- **Implementation detail:** see `.claude/context/sdk-development.md`
- **Acceptance:** `go build ./...` in go-sdk clean; Python SDK `python -m pytest tests/` passes

**Wave 4 — BE + CP** (parallel after Wave 3)

- **BE**: migrations, DAOs, service logic, gRPC presenters
- **CP**: runner fan-out compatibility verified (see [CP ↔ Runner Compatibility Contract](#cp--runner-compatibility-contract))
- **Security gate:** all handler paths check user token via service layer; no token values in logs; input validated before DB write
- **Implementation detail:** BE → `.claude/context/backend-development.md`; CP → `.claude/context/control-plane-development.md`
- **Acceptance:** `make test` passes, `go vet ./... && golangci-lint run` clean

**Wave 5 — CLI + Operator + Runners** (parallel after Wave 3 + BE)

- **CLI**: implement all 🔲 commands that are now unblocked — see `.claude/context/cli-development.md`
- **Operator**: CRD reconciler updates for Agent start — see `.claude/context/operator-development.md`
- **Runners**: inbox drain at session start, correct event types — see `.claude/context/control-plane-development.md`
- **Security gate (Operator):** all Job pods set `SecurityContext` with `AllowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, capabilities dropped; OwnerReferences set on all child resources
- **Acceptance:** CLI `make test` passes; Operator `go vet ./... && golangci-lint run` clean; Runner `python -m pytest tests/` passes; all tested in kind cluster

**Wave 6 — FE** (after Wave 4 BE)

- API service layer and React Query hooks for new entities
- UI components: Agent list, Inbox, Project Home
- **Implementation detail:** see `.claude/context/frontend-development.md`
- **Security gate:** no tokens or credentials in frontend state or logs; all API errors surface structured messages, not raw server responses
- **Acceptance:** `npm run build` — 0 errors, 0 warnings

**Wave 7 — Integration**

- End-to-end smoke: start Agent session → watch session stream → send message → confirm response
- `make test` and `make lint` across all components
- **Final step:** push new image to kind cluster (see [Mandatory Image Push Playbook](#mandatory-image-push-playbook))

Each wave is a gate.

### Step 5 — Verify the Work

After each wave is complete:

- Re-run the gap table (Step 3) for that component only
- If gaps remain, return to Step 4 for that wave
- If clean, mark that wave item as complete and proceed to the next wave

When all waves are complete and the gap table is empty, the workflow run is done. Update the Lessons Learned section of this guide with any new rules or corrections discovered during the run.

---

## Invocation

### Current

One session working through the full pipeline:

1. Human reads the spec and produces the gap table (Step 3)
2. Human works wave by wave through the pipeline, executing code changes and verifying each wave before proceeding
3. Each wave's component guide is read before implementation begins

### Future

A standing Overlord agent monitors for spec changes and automatically invokes the workflow — one session per wave, gating downstream waves on upstream completion.

---

## CP ↔ Runner Compatibility Contract

The Control Plane (CP) is a **fan-out multiplexer** — it sits between the api-server and runner pods. Multiple clients can watch the same session; the runner pushes once. CP must preserve these invariants on every change:

| Concern | Runner expects | CP must preserve |
|---|---|---|
| Session start | Job pod scheduled by operator | CP does not reschedule |
| Event emission | Runner pushes AG-UI events via gRPC | CP forwards in order, never drops |
| `RUN_FINISHED` | Emitted once at end | CP forwards exactly once — not duplicated |
| `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` | Emitted periodically | CP forwards in order |
| Token | Runner receives token from K8s secret | CP does not touch runner token |
| Non-JWT tokens | test-user-token has no username claim | CP skips ownership check when JWT username absent |

**Runner compat test (run before any CP PR):**
```bash
acpctl create session --project my-project --name test-cp "echo hello"
acpctl session messages -f --project my-project test-cp
```
Expected: `RUN_STARTED` → `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` (tokens) → `RUN_FINISHED`. No connection errors, no dropped events, no duplicate `RUN_FINISHED`.

---

## Runner Pod Addressing

The api-server does **not** have a built-in proxy to runner pods. Runner pods are addressed by Kubernetes cluster-internal DNS, constructed at request time from the session's stored fields:

```
http://session-{KubeCrName}.{KubeNamespace}.svc.cluster.local:8001
```

The `Session` model stores `KubeCrName` and `KubeNamespace` — both are available from the DB. The runner listens on port `8001` (set via `AGUI_PORT` env var by the operator; default in runner code is `8000` but the operator overrides it).

This pattern is used by `components/backend/websocket/agui_proxy.go` (the V1 backend) and by `plugins/sessions/handler.go` in the ambient-api-server. The sessions plugin implements `proxyToRunner(w, r, url)` which copies method, headers, body, and response verbatim. All workspace, files, git, repos/status, and AGUI sub-resource endpoints use this pattern. When the runner is unavailable, handlers return a stub (empty body) or `503 Service Unavailable`.

### Implementing `GET /sessions/{id}/events` (Runner SSE Proxy)

This endpoint proxies the runner pod's `GET /events/{thread_id}` SSE stream through to the client. The runner's `/events/{thread_id}` endpoint:

- Registers an asyncio queue into `bridge._active_streams[thread_id]`
- Streams every AG-UI event as SSE until `RUN_FINISHED` / `RUN_ERROR` or client disconnect
- Sends 30s keepalive pings (`: ping`) to hold the connection
- Cleans up the queue on exit regardless of how it ends

`thread_id` in the runner corresponds to the session ID (the value stored in `Session.KubeCrName`).

**Implementation steps for BE agent (Wave 4):**

1. Look up session from DB by `id` path param — get `KubeCrName` and `KubeNamespace`
2. Construct runner URL: `http://session-{KubeCrName}.{KubeNamespace}.svc.cluster.local:8001/events/{KubeCrName}`
3. Open an HTTP GET to that URL with `Accept: text/event-stream`
4. Set response headers: `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Connection: keep-alive`, `X-Accel-Buffering: no`
5. Stream the runner's SSE body directly to the client response writer, flushing after each `\n\n` boundary
6. On runner disconnect or `RUN_FINISHED` / `RUN_ERROR` event, close the client stream

**Key differences from `/sessions/{id}/messages`:**

| | `/messages` | `/events` |
|---|---|---|
| Source | api-server DB + gRPC fan-out | Runner pod SSE (live only) |
| Persistence | Persisted; supports replay from `seq=0` | Ephemeral; runner-local in-memory queue |
| Reconnect | Resume via `Last-Event-ID` / `after_seq` | No replay; live only |
| Keepalive | 30s ticker `: ping` | 30s ticker from runner; proxy must pass through |

**SSE proxy pattern** (follow `plugins/sessions/message_handler.go:streamMessages` for SSE writer setup):

```go
func (h *eventsHandler) StreamRunnerEvents(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    id := mux.Vars(r)["id"]
    session, err := h.sessionSvc.Get(r.Context(), id)
    if err != nil {
        // 404
        return
    }
    runnerURL := fmt.Sprintf("http://session-%s.%s.svc.cluster.local:8001/events/%s",
        *session.KubeCrName, *session.KubeNamespace, *session.KubeCrName)

    req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(r.Context(), http.MethodGet, runnerURL, nil)
    req.Header.Set("Accept", "text/event-stream")

    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        // 502
        return
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/event-stream")
    w.Header().Set("Cache-Control", "no-cache")
    w.Header().Set("Connection", "keep-alive")
    w.Header().Set("X-Accel-Buffering", "no")
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    if f, ok := w.(http.Flusher); ok {
        f.Flush()
    }

    io.Copy(w, resp.Body) // SSE frames pass through verbatim
    if f, ok := w.(http.Flusher); ok {
        f.Flush()
    }
}
```

Register in `plugin.go`:
```go
sessionsRouter.HandleFunc("/{id}/events", eventsHandler.StreamRunnerEvents).Methods(http.MethodGet)
```

---

## Constraints

- **Pipeline order is strict**: no downstream agent starts a wave until the upstream wave is merged and SDK is regenerated
- **One active session per wave**: a session started for a wave runs to completion before the next wave begins
- **Spec is frozen during execution**: no spec changes while a wave is in flight; queue changes for next cycle
- **PRs are atomic per wave per component**: one PR per agent per wave; avoids merge conflicts across components
- **Agents stay in their lane**: cross-component edits require a spec change and a new wave assignment

---

## Code Generation

All new Kinds must use the generator and templates in `components/ambient-api-server/templates/`. Do not hand-write plugin boilerplate.

```bash
go run ./scripts/generator.go \
  --kind Agent \
  --fields "project_id:string:required,name:string:required,prompt:string,current_session_id:string" \
  --project ambient \
  --repo github.com/ambient-code/platform/components \
  --library github.com/openshift-online/rh-trex-ai
```

Templates of interest:
| Template | Produces |
|---|---|
| `generate-openapi-kind.txt` | OpenAPI paths + schemas for a Kind |
| `generate-plugin.txt` | `plugin.go` init registration |
| `generate-dao.txt` | DAO interface + implementation |
| `generate-services.txt` | Service layer |
| `generate-handlers.txt` | HTTP handlers |
| `generate-presenters.txt` | OpenAPI ↔ model converters |
| `generate-migration.txt` | Gormigrate migration |
| `generate-mock.txt` | Mock DAO for tests |

The SDK generator (`components/ambient-sdk/`) consumes the updated `openapi.yaml` — run it after any openapi change.

---

## SDK Generator Pitfalls

These issues have caused failures in past runs. Check for them after every generator invocation.

**Nested resource base path (TS + Python):** The generator uses the first path segment of a resource's routes as the base path for generated client methods. For resources nested under `/projects/{id}/agents/...`, the generator emits `/projects` as the base path for all methods — wrong. Fix: write hand-crafted extension files that override the generated class.

- Go SDK: `go-sdk/client/agent_extensions.go` — non-CRUD methods (start, sessions, inbox)
- TS SDK: `ts-sdk/src/project_agent_api.ts`, `ts-sdk/src/inbox_message_api.ts` — complete rewrites
- After fixing the generator, delete the extension files and re-verify

**Auxiliary DTO schemas in sub-spec files:** Each `openapi.*.yaml` sub-spec file must have exactly one primary resource schema. That schema must use `allOf`. Auxiliary DTOs (request/response bodies, view models) that don't end in `List`, `PatchRequest`, or `StatusPatchRequest` must live in `openapi.yaml` main components — not in sub-spec files. The generator picks schemas alphabetically; if the first candidate lacks `allOf`, the entire parse fails.

**Generator directory naming:** Generator creates directory named `{kindLowerPlural}`. For `InboxMessage` this is `inboxMessages`, not `inbox`. Copy and rename manually when the desired package name differs.

**Generated handler variable names:** `mux.Vars` key must match the route variable name. Nested routes use `{msg_id}`, not `{id}` — generated handlers always use `{id}`. Fix after generation.

**Generated middleware import:** `RegisterRoutes` callback must use `environments.JWTMiddleware`, not `auth.JWTMiddleware`. Generated code always gets this wrong. Fix after generation.

**Generated integration tests for nested routes:** Integration tests generated by the code generator reference flat openapi client methods that don't exist when routes are nested. Stub with `t.Skip` and mark for future update.

---

## Known Code Invariants

These rules were established by fixing bugs found in production. Violating them causes panics, security holes, or incorrect behavior. Apply them when reading or writing any handler/presenter/SDK code.

**gRPC presenter completeness:** `grpc_presenter.go` `sessionToProto()` must map every field that exists in both the DB model and proto message. Missing fields cause downstream consumers (CP, operator) to receive zero values silently.

**Inbox handler scoping:** `inbox/handler.go` List must always inject `agent_id = 'X'` from URL `pa_id` into the TSL search filter. Never return cross-agent data. `listArgs.Search` is `string`, not `*string` — use empty-string checks, not nil checks.

**Inbox handler agent_id enforcement:** `inbox/handler.go` Create must set `inboxMessage.AgentId = mux.Vars(r)["pa_id"]` from the URL, ignoring any `agent_id` in the request body. Prevents body spoofing.

**Inbox presenter nil safety:** Nil-guard `UpdatedAt` independently from `CreatedAt`. They can be nil independently; treating them as a pair causes panics.

**InboxMessagePatchRequest scope:** Only `Read *bool` is permitted. No other fields. Prevents privilege escalation via PATCH.

**StartResponse field name:** `ignition_prompt` is the canonical field name across openapi, Go SDK, TS SDK. Not `ignition_context`.

**Start HTTP status:** `Start` returns HTTP 201 on new session creation, HTTP 200 when session already active. SDK `doMultiStatus()` accepts both.

**Nested resource URL encoding:** All nested resource URLs must use `encodeURIComponent` (TS) / `url.PathEscape` (Go) on every path segment.

**proto field addition:** Edit `.proto` → `make proto` → verify `*.pb.go` regenerated → wire through presenter. Do not edit `*.pb.go` directly.

---

## Mandatory Image Push Playbook

This sequence is required after every wave or bug-fix batch. Do not mark a wave complete until the rollout succeeds.

```bash
# 0. Find the running cluster name
CLUSTER=$(podman ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep 'kind' | grep 'control-plane' | sed 's/-control-plane//')
echo "Cluster: $CLUSTER"

# 1. Build without cache (cache misses source changes when go.mod/go.sum unchanged)
podman build --no-cache -t localhost/acp_api_server:latest components/ambient-api-server

# 2. Load into kind via ctr import (kind load docker-image fails with podman localhost/ prefix)
podman save localhost/acp_api_server:latest | \
  podman exec -i ${CLUSTER}-control-plane ctr --namespace=k8s.io images import -

# 3. Restart and verify
kubectl rollout restart deployment/ambient-api-server -n ambient-code
kubectl rollout status deployment/ambient-api-server -n ambient-code --timeout=60s
```

**Why `kind load docker-image` fails with podman:** It calls `docker inspect` internally and cannot resolve `localhost/` prefix images. The `podman save | ctr import` approach bypasses kind's image loader and writes directly to containerd's k8s.io namespace inside the control-plane container.

**Why `--no-cache` is required:** The Dockerfile copies source in layers. If `go.mod`/`go.sum` are unchanged, the `go build` step hits cache and emits the old binary.

---

## gRPC Local Port-Forward

The Go SDK derives the gRPC address from the REST base URL hostname + port `9000`. When pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, it derives `127.0.0.1:9000`. If local port 9000 is occupied (e.g. minio), gRPC streaming fails.

Fix for local development:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ambient-api-server 19000:9000 -n ambient-code &
export AMBIENT_GRPC_URL=127.0.0.1:19000
```

The TUI's `PortForwardEntry` for gRPC maps to local port `19000` — use this consistently.

Long-term: add `grpc_url` to `pkg/config/config.go` so it can be set once via `acpctl config set grpc_url 127.0.0.1:19000`.

## Component Development Guides

Each wave maps to one or more component development guides. Read the guide for that component before implementing — it contains file locations, code patterns, pitfalls, build commands, and acceptance criteria.

| Wave | Component | Development Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Wave 2 | API Server | `.claude/context/api-server-development.md` |
| Wave 3 | SDK | `.claude/context/sdk-development.md` |
| Wave 4 | Control Plane | `.claude/context/control-plane-development.md` |
| Wave 5 | CLI | `.claude/context/cli-development.md` |
| Wave 5 | Operator | `.claude/context/operator-development.md` |
| Wave 5 | Runner | `.claude/context/control-plane-development.md` (Runner ↔ CP contract section) |
| Wave 6 | Frontend | `.claude/context/frontend-development.md` |

The old Gin/K8s backend (`components/backend/`) is covered by `.claude/context/backend-development.md` — only relevant if you are modifying the V1 backend.

## Lessons Learned (Run Log — 2026-03-22)

### The Spec Can Lag the Code

The spec CLI table had every Agent and Inbox command marked 🔲 planned. The code had 456-line `agent/cmd.go` and 301-line `inbox/cmd.go` — fully implemented. **Always verify with `wc -l` and `go build` before assuming a gap is real.** The spec table is maintained manually; the code moves faster.

**Fix applied:** Added the Implementation Coverage Matrix to the end of the spec as the authoritative cross-component index. Update it whenever code ships, not after the next review cycle.

### SDK Extension Methods Must Be Symmetric

The `apply` command needed `GetInProject`, `ListInboxInProject`, and `SendInboxInProject` on `ProjectAgentAPI` — methods the generator would never emit for a nested resource. These had to be hand-written in `agent_extensions.go`. The pattern: any method that uses a nested URL (`/projects/{p}/agents/{a}/...`) must live in an extensions file, not in generated code.

**Rule:** When adding a new nested operation to the CLI or a new command that calls an API endpoint, check `agent_extensions.go` (or the relevant `*_extensions.go`) first. If the method isn't there, add it before writing the CLI command.

### CLI `events.go` Should Use SDK, Not Raw HTTP

The first implementation of `acpctl session events` used `net/http` directly, bypassing the SDK client (no auth header construction from config, no `X-Ambient-Project` header). This was a shortcut taken because `SessionAPI.StreamEvents` didn't exist yet.

**Fix applied:** Added `StreamEvents(ctx, sessionID) (io.ReadCloser, error)` to `session_messages.go`. Refactored `events.go` to use `connection.NewClientFromConfig()` + `client.Sessions().StreamEvents()`. Now the auth and project headers are handled consistently with all other SDK calls.

**Rule:** Never bypass the SDK client in CLI commands. If a method is missing, add it to the SDK first, then write the CLI command against it.

### `StreamEvents` Cannot Use `do()` — It Must Return the Body

The SDK's `do()` and `doMultiStatus()` methods unmarshal the response body into a typed result and close the connection. For SSE streams, you need the body open and streaming. `StreamEvents` uses `a.client.httpClient.Do(req)` directly and returns `resp.Body` as `io.ReadCloser`. The caller closes it.

This means `StreamEvents` needs access to `a.client.baseURL`, `a.client.token`, and `a.client.httpClient` — all unexported fields. Since `session_messages.go` is in the same `client` package, this works without accessors.

**Rule:** SSE / streaming endpoints require a separate implementation pattern. Do not try to fit them into `do()`. Return `io.ReadCloser` from the SDK; let the CLI layer scan it with `bufio.Scanner`.

### `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` Was Missing From CLI `go.mod`

The `apply` command imported `yaml.v3` but the CLI `go.mod` didn't declare it. The build failure message (`missing go.sum entry`) was clear but required running `go get gopkg.in/yaml.v3` to resolve. The dependency was already transitively available (via the SDK), but Go modules require explicit declaration for direct imports.

**Rule:** When adding a new file to the CLI that imports a new package, run `go build ./...` immediately. Fix `go.mod` before committing.

### Generic Proxy Is a Pre-Auth Middleware, Not a Route

`plugins/proxy/plugin.go` forwards all non-`/api/ambient/` requests to `BACKEND_URL` (default `http://localhost:8080`). It must use `pkgserver.RegisterPreAuthMiddleware` — the plugin's `RegisterRoutes` callback only receives the `/api/ambient/v1` subrouter and cannot intercept paths outside that prefix. Pre-auth middleware wraps the entire HTTP server before gorilla mux routing, so it sees every path.

**Rule:** Any endpoint that lives outside `/api/ambient/v1/` (e.g. `/health`, `/api/projects/...`, `/api/auth/...`) must be handled via `RegisterPreAuthMiddleware`. It cannot be registered as a route in a plugin's `RegisterRoutes`.

### Spec Coverage Matrix Is the Right Indexing Artifact

The gap between what the spec said (🔲 everywhere for agents/inbox) and what the code had (full implementations) was only discoverable by reading actual source files. An implementation coverage matrix embedded in the spec — with direct references to SDK method names and CLI commands — turns the spec into a live index that can be scanned in seconds.

**Rule:** The coverage matrix in `ambient-model.spec.md` is the primary index. Update it immediately when a component ships a feature. Do not rely on the CLI table alone — it maps REST→CLI but doesn't tell you what the SDK exposes.

## Lessons Learned (Run Log — 2026-05-09)

### Step 3 Gap Analysis Must Go Field-Level, Not Just Route-Level

The first pass of Step 3 during this run checked only for route existence in `openapi.yaml` and handler stubs. It found no gaps. The real gaps were at the **field level**:

- `Agent` model had 22 fields in `model.go` but the spec ERD documented only 10.
- `ScheduledSession` had 4 runtime fields (`timeout`, `inactivity_timeout`, `stop_on_run_finished`, `runner_type`) not in the spec.
- `Session.llm_max_tokens`, `timeout`, `sdk_restart_count` were `int` in the spec but `int32` in the model.
- `triggered_by_user_id` existed only in `openapi.sessions.yaml` — not in `model.go` and not in the spec. It was an OpenAPI schema artifact from an earlier design that was never implemented.

**Fix applied to Step 3:** The gap table instructions now explicitly say: "Read `plugins/<kind>/model.go` for every Kind. Compare field-by-field against the Spec. Drift here is the most common source of gaps."

**Rule:** The field-level diff of `model.go` is the highest-signal check in Step 3. Route existence is a necessary but not sufficient check. An API can have all routes defined and still have significant undocumented fields, wrong types, or phantom fields in the OpenAPI that don't exist in the model.

### Spec and OpenAPI Can Diverge From Each Other Too

`triggered_by_user_id` was present in `openapi.sessions.yaml` but absent from both the Go model and the spec. The spec → code comparison caught the spec gap, but the OpenAPI → model comparison caught a different gap: the OpenAPI had a field the model never had.

**Rule:** The gap analysis must check all three directions:
1. Spec → model (spec says field exists; does the model have it?)
2. Model → spec (model has field; is it documented in the spec?)
3. OpenAPI → model (OpenAPI declares field; is it in the model?)

### `display_name` Was Removed From Project — Proto Lags Behind

The `display_name` field was removed from `plugins/projects/model.go`, `openapi.projects.yaml`, `grpc_handler.go`, and `grpc_presenter.go`. A drop-column migration (`202505090001`) was added. However, `proto/ambient/v1/projects.proto` still declares `display_name` because the `buf` tool is not installed in the development environment and proto regeneration was deferred.

**Consequence:** The proto wire format still carries `display_name` as an optional field, but Go code no longer populates it. Per proto3 semantics this is safe — the field transmits as zero value (empty string) and is silently ignored by consumers. It is not a protocol break.

**Rule:** Before removing any field from the Go model, check `proto/ambient/v1/*.proto`. If the field appears in proto, the removal requires `buf generate` to regenerate `*.pb.go`. Do not edit `*.pb.go` manually. If `buf` is unavailable, document the proto lag explicitly in the commit message and as a follow-up task.

**Follow-up task:** Remove `display_name` from `proto/ambient/v1/projects.proto` and regenerate when `buf` is available.

### Agent Fields Propagated Through ignite_handler, Not start_handler

The Agent model has 8 fields (`repo_url`, `workflow_id`, `llm_model`, `llm_temperature`, `llm_max_tokens`, `bot_account_name`, `resource_overrides`, `environment_variables`) that are copied to Session when an agent is ignited. This happens in `plugins/agents/ignite_handler.go`, not in `start_handler.go`. `start_handler.go` does minimal field copying.

**Rule:** When auditing field propagation from Agent → Session, read `ignite_handler.go` specifically. The two handlers have different responsibilities: `start_handler.go` handles the idempotency check and session status; `ignite_handler.go` handles the full field copy and session initialization.

### Credential Scoping — Migrated to Global (2026-05-12)

Credentials were previously project-scoped at `/api/ambient/v1/projects/{id}/credentials` with a required `project_id` field on the model. The spec targets global resources at `/api/ambient/v1/credentials`.

Migration applied in one wave touching 7 files:
1. `openapi.credentials.yaml` — paths changed to `/credentials`; `project_id` removed from schema
2. `model.go` — removed `ProjectID string` field
3. `migration.go` — added `dropProjectIDMigration()` with `ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS ... DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS project_id`; kept prior `addProjectIDMigration()` so existing DBs apply and then immediately undo
4. `handler.go` — removed all `projectID := mux.Vars(r)["id"]` guards and project-filter injection in List
5. `presenter.go` — removed `ProjectId` from `PresentCredential`; updated `ConvertCredential` signature
6. `plugin.go` — changed subrouter from `/projects` prefix to `/credentials`; registered `dropProjectIDMigration()`
7. `factory_test.go` — removed `ProjectID: "test-project"` from factory struct

**SDK impact:** Generator produced `/credentials` base path correctly. `credential_extensions.go` used `a.basePath()` which no longer exists for top-level resources (generator inlines paths). Fixed by replacing with literal `/credentials/{id}/token`.

**Rule:** When the generator is used for top-level (non-nested) resources, it does NOT generate a `basePath()` method — it inlines paths. Any hand-written extension file that calls `a.basePath()` must be updated to use the literal path after changing a resource from nested to global.

### Factory Test Files Must Be Checked When Removing Model Fields

Removing a field from a model struct causes `go vet` to fail on any test factory that references the field as a struct literal key. `plugins/projectSettings/factory_test.go` had `DisplayName: stringPtr("Test Project")` that was not found by the initial grep targeting only the `projects/` plugin directory.

**Rule:** When removing a field from `plugins/{kind}/model.go`, grep the entire `plugins/` tree (not just the plugin directory) for the field name. Test factories in other plugins that create the model as a dependency will reference it too.

### Step 3 Must Produce a Field-Level Diff, Not Just a Route-Level Diff

During the credentials globalization run, Step 3 found the route `/projects/{id}/credentials` in `openapi.yaml` and marked it ✅. It did not compare the OpenAPI schema's `required` array (`["project_id", "name", "provider"]`) against the spec's Credential ERD (no `project_id`). The implementation diverged from the spec for the entire life of the feature, undetected.

**Rule:** For every Kind, Step 3 must check all three directions:
1. Spec ERD → `model.go` (spec says field exists; does the model have it?)
2. `model.go` → Spec ERD (model has a field; is it in the spec ERD?)
3. OpenAPI `required[]` → Spec ERD (OpenAPI marks a field required; does the spec agree?)

A route existing in openapi.yaml is necessary but not sufficient. Field-level drift is the most common and hardest-to-catch form of divergence.

### Integration Tests Must Assert the Spec-Correct Route, Not an Implementation-Convenient One

`plugins/credentials/factory_test.go` created credentials with `ProjectID: "test-project"` (wrong field) and `Provider: "test-provider"` (invalid enum value). These tests encoded the wrong implementation shape. Because no test ever called `POST /credentials` (the spec-correct global path), the divergence from spec went undetected for the entire history of the feature.

**Rule:** Integration tests for a resource must use the route the spec defines, not a route that happens to work in the current implementation. For a global resource (no project scope), the factory and every integration test must call the global path. If the test is written against a nested path for a resource the spec defines as global, the test is wrong — fix the test, not just the implementation.

**Corollary:** Factory test `Provider` values must use valid enum values. A factory that passes `"test-provider"` will compile and run even if the API rejects it — use `"github"` or another value from the spec's provider enum table.
