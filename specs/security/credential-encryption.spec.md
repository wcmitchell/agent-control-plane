# Credential Encryption

Credential tokens (PATs, kubeconfigs, service account keys) are stored in PostgreSQL. Today they are plaintext. This spec defines encryption at rest using AES-256-GCM with a versioned encryption key stored in a Kubernetes Secret, providing confidentiality if the database is compromised. This is a stepping stone toward Vault-only secret storage — the encryption layer is internal to the API server and invisible to all consumers.

> **Glossary:** "token" in this spec refers exclusively to the credential's stored secret value (PAT, kubeconfig, service account key), not HTTP bearer tokens or auth tokens.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Encrypted Storage

The API server SHALL encrypt credential tokens before writing them to PostgreSQL and decrypt them when reading. The `token` column SHALL contain only ciphertext after encryption is enabled. No consumer (sidecar, runner, SDK, CLI) SHALL be aware of the encryption — the API contract is unchanged.

Encryption and decryption SHALL occur at the service layer (inside `CredentialService`), not in handlers or presenters. This ensures all code paths that touch the token — including any future presenters — always receive plaintext after decryption and never accidentally expose ciphertext.

Note: the `List` handler uses `GenericService.List()` which bypasses `CredentialService` and reads raw column values. This is safe because `PresentCredential` omits the `Token` field from list/get responses. If `PresentCredential` is ever modified to include `Token`, it MUST route through `CredentialService` to ensure decryption.

No DDL or schema migration is required. The existing `token` column is PostgreSQL `TEXT` (unbounded) and accommodates the ciphertext format without modification.

#### Scenario: Create credential with encryption enabled

- GIVEN the API server has a valid encryption key configured
- WHEN a user creates a credential with `provider=github` and `token=ghp_abc123`
- THEN the `token` column in PostgreSQL contains a versioned ciphertext blob (not `ghp_abc123`)
- AND the `GET /credentials/{id}/token` response returns the original plaintext `ghp_abc123`

#### Scenario: Rotate token on existing credential

- GIVEN an encrypted credential exists
- WHEN the user patches it with a new token value
- THEN the old ciphertext is replaced with a new ciphertext of the new token
- AND the key version tag reflects the current active key

#### Scenario: API contract unchanged

- GIVEN encryption is enabled
- WHEN a sidecar calls `GET /credentials/{id}/token`
- THEN it receives the same JSON shape and plaintext token as before encryption was enabled

### Requirement: Encryption Key Management

The encryption keyring SHALL be provided as an environment variable (`CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING`) sourced from a Kubernetes Secret. The value is a JSON object mapping version numbers (as strings) to base64-encoded 32-byte keys. The active version is specified by `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION`.

Encryption key values MUST NOT appear in log output, error messages, API responses, or debug traces. Log messages about the keyring SHALL reference key versions only (e.g., "using encryption key v2, keyring contains versions: 1, 2").

#### Scenario: Server startup with valid keyring

- GIVEN `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` is set to a valid JSON keyring (e.g., `{"1":"base64key1"}`)
- AND `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION` is set to `1`
- WHEN the API server starts
- THEN it initializes the encryption subsystem and serves requests normally

#### Scenario: Server startup with missing keyring and encrypted tokens

- GIVEN `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` is not set
- AND at least one credential in the database has an encrypted token (version-prefixed ciphertext)
- WHEN the API server starts
- THEN it SHALL refuse to start and log a fatal error: "encryption keyring required but not configured"

#### Scenario: Server startup with no keyring and no encrypted tokens (fail-closed)

- GIVEN `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` is not set
- AND `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT` is not set to `true`
- WHEN the API server starts
- THEN it SHALL refuse to start and log a fatal error: "credential encryption disabled — set CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING or set CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT=true to override"

#### Scenario: Server startup with explicit plaintext opt-in

- GIVEN `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` is not set
- AND `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT` is set to `true`
- WHEN the API server starts
- THEN it SHALL start normally with encryption disabled
- AND write and read tokens as plaintext (backward-compatible)
- AND log a WARNING at startup: "credential encryption disabled — running in plaintext mode"

### Requirement: Ciphertext Format

Each encrypted token SHALL be stored as a version-tagged string with the format:

```
enc:v{N}:{base64(nonce + ciphertext + tag)}
```

Where:
- `enc:` is a fixed prefix distinguishing ciphertext from plaintext
- `v{N}` is the key version (monotonically increasing integer, starting at `1`)
- The base64 payload contains the 12-byte GCM nonce prepended to the ciphertext and authentication tag

The credential ID SHALL be bound as Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) in the GCM `Seal()`/`Open()` calls. This prevents ciphertext from being swapped between credential rows — decryption will fail if the ciphertext is moved to a different credential's row.

The version tag in the ciphertext prefix (`v{N}`) determines which key is used for decryption. The system SHALL NOT use try-decrypt fallback logic; a mismatched version tag is an error.

Plaintext tokens (pre-migration) lack the `enc:` prefix, enabling the system to distinguish encrypted from unencrypted values.

Token recognition SHALL use strict envelope validation, not just prefix matching. A value is treated as ciphertext only when all of the following hold:
1. It matches the pattern `enc:v{integer}:{base64}`
2. The base64 payload decodes successfully
3. The decoded payload is at least 28 bytes (12-byte nonce + 16-byte GCM tag minimum)

If a value has the `enc:` prefix but fails any validation step, the system SHALL treat it as a decryption error (not silently fall back to plaintext) and return an error to the caller. This prevents silent data corruption if ciphertext is truncated or corrupted.

#### Scenario: Distinguish encrypted from plaintext

- GIVEN a credential with token `enc:v1:SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=`
- WHEN the API server reads this token
- THEN it detects the `enc:` prefix and decrypts using key version 1

#### Scenario: Legacy plaintext token

- GIVEN a credential with token `ghp_abc123` (no `enc:` prefix)
- AND `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` and `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION` are configured
- WHEN the API server reads this token via `GET /credentials/{id}/token`
- THEN it returns the plaintext value as-is (no decryption needed)
- AND the token remains plaintext in the database until explicitly migrated

### Requirement: Key Rotation

The API server SHALL support rotating the encryption key via the `encrypt-credentials` CLI command, which bulk re-encrypts all tokens with the current key.

#### Scenario: Bulk re-encrypt

- GIVEN 50 credentials exist, all encrypted with key version 1
- AND the operator deploys a new encryption key (version 2) via the K8s Secret
- WHEN the operator runs `ambient-api-server encrypt-credentials`
- THEN all 50 tokens are decrypted with the version-1 key and re-encrypted with the version-2 key
- AND each token's version tag updates from `v1` to `v2`
- AND the command reports: "50 credentials re-encrypted from v1 to v2"

#### Scenario: Interrupted re-encryption

- GIVEN a bulk re-encrypt is running
- WHEN it fails after processing 30 of 50 credentials
- THEN 30 credentials are tagged `v2` and 20 remain tagged `v1`
- AND the command exits with an error listing the 20 unprocessed credential IDs
- AND a subsequent run of `encrypt-credentials` processes only the remaining `v1` credentials

#### Scenario: Key version tracking

- GIVEN a K8s Secret containing the encryption keyring
- WHEN the operator needs to rotate
- THEN they add the new key to `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` with the next version number
- AND set `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION` to the new version (e.g., `2`)
- AND old keys MUST be retained in the keyring until `encrypt-credentials` re-encrypts all tokens to the current version

### Requirement: Initial Migration

The `encrypt-credentials` CLI command SHALL encrypt all existing plaintext tokens in-place.

#### Scenario: First-time encryption

- GIVEN 100 credentials exist with plaintext tokens (no `enc:` prefix)
- AND `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` is configured with version 1
- WHEN the operator runs `ambient-api-server encrypt-credentials`
- THEN all 100 tokens are encrypted with the version-1 key
- AND each token is updated to `enc:v1:{ciphertext}`
- AND the command reports: "100 credentials encrypted (plaintext → v1)"

#### Scenario: Idempotent execution

- GIVEN all credentials are already encrypted with version 1
- WHEN the operator runs `encrypt-credentials` with the same version-1 key
- THEN the command reports: "0 credentials need encryption. All up to date."
- AND no database writes occur

### Requirement: Decryption Rollback

The `encrypt-credentials` command SHALL support a `--decrypt` flag that reverses all encrypted tokens to plaintext in the database.

The `--decrypt` flag requires all encryption key versions referenced by stored ciphertext to be present in the keyring. If tokens span `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, all three keys MUST be in `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING`.

#### Scenario: Bulk decrypt

- GIVEN 50 credentials exist with encrypted tokens (all `enc:v1:...`)
- WHEN the operator runs `ambient-api-server encrypt-credentials --decrypt`
- THEN all 50 tokens are decrypted and stored as plaintext (no `enc:` prefix)
- AND the command reports: "50 credentials decrypted to plaintext"

#### Scenario: Decrypt after partial rotation

- GIVEN 30 credentials are `enc:v2` and 20 are `enc:v1`
- AND both keys are available in the keyring
- WHEN the operator runs `encrypt-credentials --decrypt`
- THEN all 50 tokens are decrypted to plaintext using their respective key versions

### Requirement: CLI Integration

The `encrypt-credentials` command SHALL be a cobra subcommand of `ambient-api-server`, alongside the existing `serve` and `migrate` commands. It SHALL reuse the existing `SessionFactory` for database access and the standard environment system for configuration.

The command operates directly on the database — it does not go through the REST API. It is a privileged operation intended for platform operators with direct database and K8s Secret access. No application-level RBAC role grants access to this command; authorization is enforced by infrastructure access (K8s RBAC on the pod/namespace and database credentials).

Decrypted token values are never exposed to end users. The `GET /credentials/{id}/token` endpoint requires the `credential:token-reader` role, which is granted only to runner service accounts — not to human users.

#### Scenario: Command execution

- GIVEN the operator has `kubectl exec` access to the API server pod (or runs the binary locally with DB connectivity)
- WHEN they run `ambient-api-server encrypt-credentials`
- THEN the command connects to PostgreSQL, processes all credential tokens, and exits

#### Scenario: Dry run

- GIVEN credentials exist in mixed states (some plaintext, some encrypted)
- WHEN the operator runs `ambient-api-server encrypt-credentials --dry-run`
- THEN the command reports what it would do without modifying any data
- AND outputs: "Would encrypt: 30 plaintext, Would re-encrypt: 20 (v1 → v2), Already current: 50"

### Requirement: Vault Migration Path

The encryption layer SHALL be implemented as an internal concern of the credential plugin, not exposed in the API schema or OpenAPI spec. This enables a future migration to Vault-only storage by:
1. Replacing the encrypt/decrypt functions with Vault Transit API calls
2. Or replacing the token column with a Vault path reference

No API, SDK, CLI, sidecar, or runner changes SHALL be required when the storage backend changes.

#### Scenario: Future Vault adoption

- GIVEN the API server currently uses AES-256-GCM with a K8s Secret key
- WHEN the team migrates to Vault Transit
- THEN only the encryption/decryption functions inside the credential plugin change
- AND the `GET /credentials/{id}/token` response is identical
- AND no consumer needs modification

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` | No (see startup scenarios) | JSON object mapping version numbers to base64-encoded 32-byte keys. E.g., `{"1":"base64key1","2":"base64key2"}`. Sourced from K8s Secret. All keys referenced by stored ciphertext MUST be present. |
| `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION` | When keyring is set | Integer version of the active key used for new encryptions (e.g., `2`). Must exist in the keyring. |
| `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT` | No | Set to `true` to allow startup without encryption. Without this, the server fails closed if no keyring is configured. |

## Audit-Driven Requirements

> Requirements in this section address findings from the 2026-07 ProdSec security audit.
> Each requirement references the originating finding ID (fNNN) for traceability.

### Requirement: Production Overlays Must Enable Encryption (f024)

The `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT` setting SHALL be `false` in all production
and production-equivalent overlays. The production and mpp-openshift overlays currently
set `ALLOW_PLAINTEXT=true`, storing tenant provider tokens unencrypted in PostgreSQL.

Combined with the hardcoded database password (f023), cluster-wide network reachability
(f027), and SQL injection via `orderBy` (f006), plaintext credential storage enables
database-level cross-tenant credential exfiltration.

The encryption implementation (AES-256-GCM, AAD, versioned keyring) is sound — it is
simply disabled where it matters most. All production overlays SHALL:
1. Provision a `credential-encryption-keyring` Secret (following the hcmais pattern)
2. Set `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT=false`
3. Run the `encrypt_credentials` migration before enabling enforcement
4. Remove the plaintext escape hatch at the code level for `AMBIENT_ENV=production`

#### Scenario: Production overlay enforces encryption

- GIVEN the production overlay at `components/manifests/overlays/production/`
- WHEN the API server starts in production
- THEN `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT` is `false`
- AND `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` is set from a provisioned Secret
- AND the server refuses to start if the keyring is missing

#### Scenario: Plaintext opt-in blocked in production

- GIVEN `AMBIENT_ENV=production`
- WHEN `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT=true` is set
- THEN the API server SHALL refuse to start
- AND log a fatal error: "plaintext credential storage is not permitted in production"

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| AES-256-GCM | Authenticated encryption. Go stdlib (`crypto/aes` + `crypto/cipher`). No external dependencies. Industry standard. 96-bit random nonce; birthday collision risk negligible at credential-scale volumes (well under 2^32 encryptions). |
| Credential ID as AAD | Binding the credential ID as GCM additional authenticated data prevents ciphertext swapping between database rows. Decryption fails if a ciphertext blob is copied to a different credential's row. |
| Version-tagged ciphertext | Enables safe key rotation — the system always knows which key encrypted a given token. Also distinguishes encrypted from legacy plaintext. |
| JSON keyring env var | Supports arbitrary number of historical key versions in a single env var. Version-tagged ciphertext selects the correct key from the keyring — no try-decrypt fallback needed. Consistent with existing API server config pattern (env vars from K8s Secrets). |
| Explicit CLI command for migration | Follows industry practice (Rails, Django, Kubernetes, Vault). Never auto-encrypt on startup — the operation is privileged, auditable, and must be recoverable from partial failure. |
| Encryption at service layer | Decrypt in `CredentialService.Get()`, encrypt in `CredentialService.Create()`/`Replace()`. Handlers and presenters never see ciphertext. Prevents accidental exposure if new presenters are added. |
| Encryption invisible to API consumers | The `GET /credentials/{id}/token` contract is unchanged. Sidecars, runners, SDK, CLI are unaware. This maximizes the migration surface to Vault later. |
| Fail-closed without key | Server refuses to start unless a keyring is configured or `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT=true` is set. Prevents silent plaintext degradation in production. Dev environments opt in explicitly. |
| No DDL migration required | The `token` column is PostgreSQL `TEXT` (unbounded). Ciphertext with the `enc:v1:...` prefix fits without schema changes. |
| `--decrypt` rollback supported | The decrypt capability exists inherently (needed for `GET /token`). A `--decrypt` flag on the CLI command reverses encryption if the feature must be rolled back. |
| Cobra subcommand, not gormigrate | `encrypt-credentials` is a standalone subcommand like `serve` and `migrate`, not a numbered migration. It's re-runnable, idempotent, and supports `--dry-run` and `--decrypt` flags. |
