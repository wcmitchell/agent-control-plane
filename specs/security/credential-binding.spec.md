# Credential Binding

Credentials are global resources. Access to a credential's token at session runtime is governed by `scope=credential` RoleBindings that link a credential to a project or a specific agent within a project. The control plane resolves which credentials a session receives by walking these bindings from most-specific to least-specific scope. A credential with no binding covering the session's project and agent is not injected.

This spec defines the resolver algorithm, authorization rules for creating bindings at each level, and the `credential:token-reader` grant lifecycle.

## Terminology

- **Agent-level binding**: A `scope=credential` RoleBinding with `credential_id`, `project_id`, and `agent_id` all set. Grants the credential to one specific agent.
- **Project-level binding**: A `scope=credential` RoleBinding with `credential_id` and `project_id` set, `agent_id` NULL. Grants the credential to all agents in the project.
- **Global binding**: A `scope=credential` RoleBinding with `credential_id` set, `project_id` NULL, `agent_id` NULL. Grants the credential as a platform-wide default.
- **Session OIDC service identity**: A machine identity provisioned by the control plane at session start via OIDC `client_credentials` grant. Materializes as a `user_id` in RoleBinding records (e.g., `service-account-<client-id>`). The control plane uses this identity to grant `credential:token-reader` bindings on behalf of the session pod.

## Dependencies

- **Global credential binding pattern**: The `scope=credential` binding with both `project_id=NULL` and `agent_id=NULL` is a new pattern. `ambient-model.spec.md` SHALL be amended to document this as valid for credential scope.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Hierarchical Credential Resolution

The control plane SHALL resolve credentials for a session by walking `scope=credential` RoleBindings from most-specific to least-specific scope: **agent → project → global**.

For each credential provider (github, gitlab, google, jira, kubeconfig, vertex):

1. If a `scope=credential` binding exists where `credential_id` references a credential of this provider, `project_id` matches the session's project, AND `agent_id` matches the session's agent — use that credential (**agent-level binding**).
2. Otherwise, if a `scope=credential` binding exists where `credential_id` references a credential of this provider, `project_id` matches the session's project, AND `agent_id` is NULL — use that credential (**project-level binding**).
3. Otherwise, if a `scope=credential` binding exists where `credential_id` references a credential of this provider, `project_id` is NULL, AND `agent_id` is NULL — use that credential (**global binding**).
4. Otherwise, no credential is injected for this provider.

The API server SHALL reject creation of duplicate bindings at the same scope level for the same provider (same `credential.provider`, same `project_id`, same `agent_id`). If duplicates exist despite this (e.g., from prior data), the binding with the earliest `created_at` timestamp wins.

#### Scenario: Agent-level binding overrides project-level

- GIVEN credential A (provider=github) is bound to project P with `agent_id=NULL`
- AND credential B (provider=github) is bound to project P with `agent_id=agent-1`
- WHEN a session starts for agent-1 in project P
- THEN the session receives credential B (agent-level wins)

#### Scenario: Project-level binding used when no agent-level exists

- GIVEN credential A (provider=github) is bound to project P with `agent_id=NULL`
- AND no agent-level github binding exists for agent-1 in project P
- WHEN a session starts for agent-1 in project P
- THEN the session receives credential A (project-level fallback)

#### Scenario: No binding means no injection

- GIVEN credential A (provider=github) is bound to project P
- AND no github credential is bound to project Q at any level
- WHEN a session starts in project Q
- THEN no github credential is injected into the session

#### Scenario: Multiple providers resolved independently

- GIVEN credential A (provider=github) is bound to project P at project-level
- AND credential B (provider=jira) is bound to project P at agent-level for agent-1
- AND no google credential is bound to project P
- WHEN a session starts for agent-1 in project P
- THEN the session receives credential A (github, project-level) and credential B (jira, agent-level)
- AND no google credential is injected

#### Scenario: Global binding provides default

- GIVEN credential A (provider=github) has a `scope=credential` binding with `project_id=NULL` and `agent_id=NULL`
- AND no project-level or agent-level github binding exists for project P
- WHEN a session starts in project P
- THEN the session receives credential A (global fallback)

#### Scenario: Agent-level binding overrides global

- GIVEN credential A (provider=github) has a global binding (`project_id=NULL`, `agent_id=NULL`)
- AND credential B (provider=github) is bound to project P with `agent_id=agent-1`
- WHEN a session starts for agent-1 in project P
- THEN the session receives credential B (agent-level overrides global)

### Requirement: Credential Binding Authorization

**Binding** (creating) and **unbinding** (deleting) `scope=credential` RoleBindings have asymmetric authorization rules. Binding grants access to a secret and requires ownership of both sides. Unbinding revokes access from a project and only requires ownership of the destination.

#### Binding (create)

**All credential bindings** require the caller to hold `credential:owner` on the target credential. You can only bind credentials you own.

**Project-level and agent-level bindings** additionally require the caller to hold `project:editor` or higher on the target project.

**Agent-level bindings** additionally require:
1. The specified agent to belong to the project specified in the binding (`project_id`), validated by the API server
2. The `project_id` to be non-NULL (agent-credential bindings without a project are invalid)

**Global bindings** additionally require the caller to hold `platform:admin`.

#### Unbinding (delete)

**Project-level and agent-level bindings** require the caller to hold `project:editor` or higher on the binding's project. The caller does NOT need `credential:owner` — a project editor/owner can remove any credential from their project regardless of who bound it.

**Global bindings** require the caller to hold `platform:admin`.

#### Scenario: Project owner binds own credential to project

- GIVEN user A holds `credential:owner` on credential C
- AND user A holds `project:owner` on project P
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `project_id=P`, `agent_id=NULL`
- THEN the binding is created (201)

#### Scenario: Project owner binds own credential to specific agent

- GIVEN user A holds `credential:owner` on credential C
- AND user A holds `project:owner` on project P
- AND agent-1 belongs to project P
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `project_id=P`, `agent_id=agent-1`
- THEN the binding is created (201)

#### Scenario: Non-credential-owner cannot bind

- GIVEN user A does NOT hold `credential:owner` on credential C
- AND user A holds `project:owner` on project P
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `project_id=P`
- THEN the request returns 403 Forbidden

#### Scenario: Project editor binds own credential to project

- GIVEN user A holds `credential:owner` on credential C
- AND user A holds `project:editor` on project P
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `project_id=P`
- THEN the binding is created (201)

#### Scenario: Project viewer cannot bind credentials

- GIVEN user A holds `credential:owner` on credential C
- AND user A holds `project:viewer` on project P
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `project_id=P`
- THEN the request returns 403 Forbidden

#### Scenario: Non-project-member cannot bind credential

- GIVEN user A holds `credential:owner` on credential C
- AND user A has no role on project P
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `project_id=P`, `agent_id=agent-1`
- THEN the request returns 403 Forbidden

#### Scenario: Agent-credential binding requires project_id

- GIVEN user A holds `credential:owner` on credential C
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `agent_id=agent-1`, `project_id=NULL`
- THEN the request returns 400 Bad Request
- AND the error indicates that agent-scoped credential bindings require a project_id

#### Scenario: Agent must belong to the specified project

- GIVEN user A holds `credential:owner` on credential C
- AND user A holds `project:owner` on project P
- AND agent-1 belongs to project Q (not P)
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `project_id=P`, `agent_id=agent-1`
- THEN the request returns 400 Bad Request

#### Scenario: Platform admin creates global credential binding

- GIVEN user A holds `platform:admin`
- AND user A holds `credential:owner` on credential C
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `project_id=NULL`, `agent_id=NULL`
- THEN the binding is created (201)

#### Scenario: Non-admin cannot create global credential binding

- GIVEN user A holds `credential:owner` on credential C
- AND user A does NOT hold `platform:admin`
- WHEN user A creates a RoleBinding with `scope=credential`, `credential_id=C`, `project_id=NULL`, `agent_id=NULL`
- THEN the request returns 403 Forbidden

#### Scenario: Project editor unbinds credential they don't own

- GIVEN user B (not credential owner) holds `project:editor` on project P
- AND credential C (owned by user A) is bound to project P
- WHEN user B deletes the `scope=credential` RoleBinding for credential C on project P
- THEN the binding is deleted (204)

#### Scenario: Project viewer cannot unbind

- GIVEN user A holds `project:viewer` on project P
- AND credential C is bound to project P
- WHEN user A deletes the `scope=credential` RoleBinding for credential C on project P
- THEN the request returns 403 Forbidden

### Requirement: credential:token-reader Grant Lifecycle

The control plane SHALL grant `credential:token-reader` to the session's OIDC service identity for each credential resolved by the hierarchical resolver. This grant SHALL be scoped to the specific credential and SHALL be revoked when the session terminates.

The control plane authenticates as a platform service account and creates these bindings via the standard `POST /role_bindings` API. Because `credential:token-reader` is an internal role, only service callers (not human users) can create these bindings.

#### Scenario: Token-reader granted at session start

- GIVEN credential A is resolved for a session via the hierarchical resolver
- WHEN the control plane provisions the session pod
- THEN a RoleBinding is created with `role=credential:token-reader`, `scope=credential`, `credential_id=A`, `user_id=<session-oidc-service-account>`

#### Scenario: Token-reader revoked at session end

- GIVEN a session was provisioned with `credential:token-reader` for credential A
- WHEN the session terminates (Completed, Failed, or Stopped)
- THEN the `credential:token-reader` RoleBinding for credential A is deleted

#### Scenario: Sidecar can fetch token with granted role

- GIVEN the control plane granted `credential:token-reader` for credential A to the session's service identity
- WHEN the credential sidecar calls `GET /credentials/{A}/token` with the session's bearer token
- THEN the API server returns the decrypted token (200)

#### Scenario: Sidecar cannot fetch unbound credential token

- GIVEN credential B was NOT resolved for this session (no binding)
- AND no `credential:token-reader` was granted for credential B
- WHEN the credential sidecar calls `GET /credentials/{B}/token`
- THEN the API server returns 404

### Requirement: Binding Deletion Does Not Affect Running Sessions

Deleting a `scope=credential` RoleBinding SHALL NOT terminate running sessions that were provisioned with the previously-bound credential. The credential remains available for the session's lifetime via its existing `credential:token-reader` grant. New sessions started after the binding deletion SHALL NOT receive the credential.

#### Scenario: Running session keeps credential after binding deleted

- GIVEN a session is Running with credential A (bound at project-level)
- WHEN the project-level binding for credential A is deleted
- THEN the running session continues to use credential A
- AND the `credential:token-reader` grant for this session is NOT revoked

#### Scenario: New session does not receive deleted binding's credential

- GIVEN the project-level binding for credential A on project P was deleted
- WHEN a new session starts in project P
- THEN credential A is NOT injected (resolver finds no matching binding)

## Audit-Driven Requirements

> Requirements in this section address findings from the 2026-07 ProdSec security audit.
> Each requirement references the originating finding ID (fNNN) for traceability.

### Requirement: Group Names Must Be Sanitized in RoleBindings (f056)

Tenant-supplied group names used in `reconcileGroupAccess` SHALL be validated
against a denylist of `system:` prefixed groups and wildcard-scope groups before
creating Kubernetes RoleBindings. A project admin can currently bind synthetic
groups such as `system:authenticated` or `system:serviceaccounts` to project
roles, silently granting every cluster identity admin access to the namespace.

#### Scenario: system: group binding rejected

- GIVEN a project admin sets a group name of `system:authenticated`
- WHEN the ProjectSettingsReconciler processes the group access config
- THEN the group name is rejected (matches `system:` denylist)
- AND no RoleBinding is created for that group

#### Scenario: Valid group name accepted

- GIVEN a project admin sets a group name of `team-ambient`
- WHEN the ProjectSettingsReconciler processes the group access config
- THEN the RoleBinding is created with `kind: Group, name: team-ambient`

## Migration

### Existing consumers

| Consumer | Current behavior | Required change |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Control plane `resolveCredentialIDs` | Lists all credentials via `sdk.Credentials().ListAll()`, picks first per provider | Query `scope=credential` RoleBindings filtered by `project_id` and `agent_id`, implement hierarchical resolution |
| RBAC middleware (credential binding creation) | Validates `credential:owner` + `project:owner` for project-level bindings | Relax bind check to `project:editor`+, add agent-level validation (verify agent belongs to project), global bindings (require `platform:admin`), reject `agent_id` without `project_id`, and asymmetric unbind auth (`project:editor`+ can unbind without `credential:owner`) |
| Credential sidecar entrypoint | Fetches token via bearer token from CP token exchange | No change — consumes `CREDENTIAL_IDS` produced by CP |
| Runner `populate_runtime_credentials` | Fetches tokens from `CREDENTIAL_IDS` env var | No change — consumes `CREDENTIAL_IDS` produced by CP |
| UI binding matrix | Creates RoleBindings with `credential_id` + `project_id` ± `agent_id` | No change — already creates correct binding structure |

### Specs requiring amendment

| Spec | Amendment |
|------|-----------|
| `rbac-enforcement.spec.md` | Relax credential binding from `project:owner` to `project:editor`+; document bind/unbind asymmetry (editors can unbind without `credential:owner`) |
| `ambient-model.spec.md` | Document global credential binding pattern (`scope=credential` with `project_id=NULL`, `agent_id=NULL`); add credential binding scope terms (agent-level, project-level, global) |
